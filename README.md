# PYTHON TESTS

### Learning goals

**June 3, 2018**
Though I've used it before, I am very new to python, especially python 3.
What I'd like to do with the next month is utilize my datacamp.com membership to learn:

[] python syntax
[] common ML libraries (scikit)
[] common NLP libraries
[] charting and visualization options
[] project structure, tooling and testing

Datacamp also has a practice feature, so I'm trying to stick with daily practice too.
