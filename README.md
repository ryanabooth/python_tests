# PYTHON TESTS

### Learning goals

**June 3, 2018**

Though I've used it before, I am very new to python (especially python 3).

I'd like to use my datacamp.com membership during the next month to learn:

- [ ] python syntax
- [ ] common ML libraries (scikit)
- [ ] common NLP libraries
- [ ] charting and visualization options
- [ ] project structure, tooling and testing

Datacamp also has a practice feature, so I'm trying to stick to daily practice too.

My profile is here at [datacamp.com/profile/ryanabooth](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/ryanabooth).
